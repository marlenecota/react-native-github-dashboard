If the bug cannot be reproduced, your issue may be closed.\r\n-->\r\nXbox narrator cannot announce Section Header of the section list. Picture this, a visually impaired user navigates through a gaming event page. When the user navigates into a section filled with screenshots of a game, they will not be told they are currently in the \"screenshot\" section. Similarly, if an user is browsing through \"Related games\" on the bottom of a game product page, they will not be able to know the games they are hearing are \"related games\". This is a crucial feature for accessibility.\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\nNote: \r\n1. Create a SectionList filled with buttons as items, and make sure to have section titles\r\n2. Turn on system's narrator\r\n3. Land focus on the first item of a section\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nNarrator should announce the section header, so users know the section they are in.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect your project to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write what you thought would happen.)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nSection header is not being announced. Only the text of the button was announced.\r\n\r\n(Write what happened. Add screenshots!)\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app using https://snack.expo.io/ and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a Snack.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, copy and paste the link to the Snack or a public GitHub repository below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you,\r\n  but it’s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,\r\n  the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.\r\n\r\n  Please remember that:\r\n\r\n    * Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.\r\n    * The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.\r\n    * You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

    "body": "Part 1: The path is too fragile\r\n\r\nCurrently C# and C++ UWP apps build slightly different paths.  And the current mechanism in deployToWindows is quite fragile and too specific\r\n\r\n```return glob.sync(`windows/*/AppPackages/*_${options.arch}_${configuration}_*`)[0];```\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/48a23b5181c7e91c1ec243c9556a6e81351a8927/vnext/local-cli/runWindows/utils/deploy.js#L21\r\n\r\nShould be changed to this instead ```return glob.sync(`windows/**/AppPackages/*_${options.arch}_${configuration}_*`)[0];``` \r\nNote the * to ** after windows/\r\nSo that it can better capture different paths. In my particular case the default path is\r\n`\\windows\\target\\x64\\Debug\\UwpAppName\\UwpAppName\\AppPackages\\UwpAppName_1.0.0.0_x64_Debug_Test`\r\n\r\npart 2.\r\nAlso looking for the AppxManifest.xml \r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/48a23b5181c7e91c1ec243c9556a6e81351a8927/vnext/local-cli/runWindows/utils/deploy.js#L34\r\n\r\nIn the C++ UWP this generates to\r\n``` `windows/target/${options.arch}/${configuration}/appName/AppName/AppxManifest.xml`) ```\r\nSo this would work.  ``` const appxPath = glob.sync(path.join(options.root, `windows/*/${options.arch}/${configuration}/**/AppxManifest.xml`))[0]; ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart 3.\r\nAlthough it does properly rely on Add-AppDevPackage instead of *.appx now. It then falls back onto a WindowsStoreAppUtils.ps1\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/48a23b5181c7e91c1ec243c9556a6e81351a8927/vnext/local-cli/runWindows/utils/WindowsStoreAppUtils.ps1#L94\r\n\r\nWhich is out dated and only supports appx and appxbundle. \r\nBut comparing it against the Add-AppDevPackage which supports appx, msix (the new format), appxbundle, msixbundle, among others. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, a lot of the functionality of WindowsStoreAppUtils, shouldn't even be needed anymore since Add-AppDevPackage should be handling most of the stuff here now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of this post, I was still using \"react-native-windows\": \"0.59.0-vnext.32\", but it doesn't appear to be resolved as of July 2, 2019.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "# Proposal: Safer focus lost behavior\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nIn Xaml, when the focused control is removed from the visual tree, focus moves to the first element in the window.  This differs from other platforms (I don't know how each works, but Xaml seems uniquely extreme in this) - I believe most platforms will find the nearest focusable element or at least keep focus in the same 'window' if focus was in a flyout or subwindow.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe have had multiple bugs in our current usage of RNW where a render() update removes the focused element.  We've had to add code outside of RNW to notice when this is happening and restore focus back into the RNW control.\r\n\r\nvnext's 'safe harbor' feature which when calling blur() will move focus to the root of the reactcontrol is perhaps part of a solution - if it also worked to safe harbor within the nearest 'window' and not just the root.  Requiring the call to blur() is also a problem though if its not needed on other platforms.  react-native developers on other platforms are unlikely to be aware of this Xaml behavior and some kind of 'auto-blur' behavior on removal seems desirable.\r\n\r\n## Basic example\r\n\r\nHave a RN layout where a Touchable's onPress will re-render and create a different tree with different buttons.  Focus will jump to the root of the window.  If doing this in a flyout, focus jumps all the way to parent window root.\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\nI attempted to start implementing this just using the current safe harbor, by checking if the current view being removed is the focused element.\r\n1. That wouldn't solve the sub-window case\r\n2. When re-rendering a tree of elements, the elements much higher in the tree are going to be removed first.  So instead of checking if the view being removed is focused, I had to check if the focused element is a child of the view being removed.  I wasn't sure of an efficient check for this and ended up having to walk all the parents up to the root from the focused element seeing it one of them was the element being removed. \r\n3. On RS4+ Platforms OnLosingFocus() could maybe be used to help with this.  Thats what we did with our LivePersonaCard feature, but it didn't work on RS3 due to unavailable APIs.  The app there notices focus movement and closes flyouts automatically on focus lost - fixing focus quickly isn't enough since nothing is async in the flyout manager."

    "body": "# Proposal: Add FontFamily registration system\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nOn UWP, custom fonts are referenced with a string like \"/Path/to/font.ttf#Font name\" where the path is relative to the app's install path. This is problematic for a few reasons, listed below.\r\n\r\nRequest: Allow developers to configure a mapping of Font Name to \"path#Name\" string as part of React Native Windows initialization. When a `fontFamily` style is set, look up and, if available, use the value from the map when constructing the XAML FontFamily instance.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nOn iOS, custom fonts added to an RN app can be referenced by their name. On Android, they can be referenced by the file name without the extension, which can typically be made to match the font name. This allows components that use the `fontFamily` style to be fairly portable.\r\n\r\nOn UWP, custom fonts are referenced with a string like \"/Path/to/font#Font name\". This string does not match iOS or Android, and is unique to the consuming application's folder structure, making it non-portable. \r\n\r\nAn app might workaround this by replacing fontFamily usages within its codebase with a helper function to generate the correct string. Shared component library authors with default font styles might add helper functions or a registration system themselves. Either case invites unique implementations rather than consistency across the platform. Building a solution into RNW directly would alleviate this problem.\r\n\r\n## Basic example\r\n```\r\n#include <ReactUWP/Utils/ValueUtils.h>\r\n\r\nmap<string, string> fontAliases = { { \"MyFont\", \"/Assets/MyFont.ttf#MyFont\" } };\r\nreact::uwp::SetFontFamilyPaths(fontAliases);\r\n```\r\n```\r\nconst textStyle = {\r\n    fontFamily: \"MyFont\"\r\n};\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n    return <Text style={textStyle} />;\r\n}\r\n```"

    "body": "# Align AppTheme API with Lean Core Appearance API\r\nWe have a Windows-only API module called AppTheme. Which enables you to listen to the dark and light theme state changes for Windows.\r\n\r\nAs of [this commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/63fa3f21c5ab308def450bffb22054241a8842ef), React Native core has an iOS and Android ones. It operates very similarly to how ours does, but there are some API name changes.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to align the names with the Lean Core implementation, so that we can push up the Windows theme changed event work up to React Native to sit along side the iOS and Android implementations.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n<!-- Brief explanation of the new API or change. -->\r\nWe must make sure our Windows implementation of the theme changed event maps to the React Native `Appearance ` and the `getColorScheme()` function, instead of `AppTheme` and the `currentTheme` string property.\r\n\r\nWe should also separately PR the highContrastedChanged work into the `Appearance` API to enable support for that type of theme change.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn order for our Windows implementation of theme changed events to work properly in React Native's lean core, we must align with their implementation of theme changed events.\r\n\r\n> This Windows alignment is happening on the JS-layer only.\r\n\r\nThe JS API to align with can be found in the [Libraries/Utilities/Appearance.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Utilities/Appearance.js) file on the React Native repo.\r\n\r\n## Basic example\r\n\r\n<!-- [Optional] If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example. Omit this section if it's not applicable. -->\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nimport { Appearance } from 'react-native'\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Button title='click me' color={Appearance.getColorScheme() === 'dark' ? 'grey' : 'orange'}></Button>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing Back\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, it's important that during this alignment that we do not lose the `highContrastedChanged` implemented within AppTheme. This is an important feature for windows users and something we should contribute back to React Native core with."

Observe that the Picker does not have rounded corners\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Picker, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\r\n\r\nconst styleSheet = StyleSheet.create({\r\n    roundedCorners: {\r\n        borderRadius: 3,\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n    return (\r\n          <Picker style={styleSheet.roundedCorners}>\r\n                <Picker.Item label=\"Any\" value=\"Any\" />\r\n          </Picker>\r\n     );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect your project to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI expected the Picker to have rounded corners using the supplied border radius.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Describe this section in detail, and attach screenshots if possible.\r\n  Don't just say \"it doesn't work\"!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nApplying the \"borderRadius\" style did not visually change the box.
