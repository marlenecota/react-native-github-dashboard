These are all written in flow, so the only way to get real type checking if for our files to be written in flow too.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nreact-native use Jest for the JS testing and we need to do it too. and it's possible to share the test case."

A separate daily pipeline built outside of react-native-windows that replicates the developer experience would give us a better safety net.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nAny break to our Getting Started steps is very painful to new developers. We promise that those steps work, so we should validate that.\r\n"

In order to deprecate old AS module, we've ditched `NativeModule`'s name from `AsyncLocalStorage` to `PlatformLocalStorage`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, [`RN-windows` uses deprecated name](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/rnwcpp-preview/RNWCPP/Shared/AsyncStorageModule.cpp#L23), so it'd be great to keep it in sync.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\nthanks."

This does happen as expected, but when I change the condition to false again, such that the text no longer renders, the view still remains the same size, despite having changed before to accommodate the initial rendering of the text. \r\n```\r\n<MyCustomButton\r\n    style={styles.button}\r\n    onPress={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}\r\n>\r\n            <View style={[styles.view, {backgroundColor: '#00000066'}]}>\r\n                <Text style={styles.text}>{\"String\"}</Text>\r\n                <Text style={styles.text}>{\"String\"}</Text>\r\n                {expanded && <><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text></>}\r\n            </View>\r\n</MyCustomButton>\r\n```\r\nHowever, if I wrap each Text element in a view, or the entire series of Text elements, it behaves as expected. \r\n```\r\n<MyCustomButton\r\n    style={styles.button}\r\n    onPress={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}\r\n>\r\n            <View style={[styles.view, {backgroundColor: '#00000066'}]}>\r\n                <Text style={styles.text}>{\"String\"}</Text>\r\n                <Text style={styles.text}>{\"String\"}</Text>\r\n                {expanded && <View><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text><Text>{\"Hi\"}</Text></View>}\r\n            </View>\r\n</MyCustomButton>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe view would shrink as the text is no longer rendered\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe view expands initially when the text is set to render, however, does not contract when the text is set to not render (the text _does_ properly disappear though).\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAdam Gorman(adamgor)\r\nAustin Beaulieu(aubeauli)\r\n"

    "body": ">kikisaints: I'm taking over this issue to post the draft proposal for this spec in an easily accessible place where people can provide feedback, as a gist is too private.\r\n\r\n# Mouse Event APIs\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nComponents need the ability to handle pointer events and implement custom logic when interacting with a React Native app using any pointing device. This proposal outlines the basic props and events needed to enable those scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are several use-cases where end users may interact with `react-native` applications using a pointing device.\r\n\r\nThese include:\r\n- Surface, iPad and Android tablet devices with a pen or mouse device connected or being used with\r\n- `react-native-windows` apps that will be deployed on PCs and laptop computers\r\n- `react-native-web` apps that could be used in any end point including Chromebooks, PCs and tablet devices\r\n- Any React Native app that targets a platform that supports pointer device(s) (e.g. HoloLens)\r\n\r\n>**Pointer/pointing device** = generical term for any device used to control the movement of a cursor on a display screen.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with the minimal set of APIs needed to achieve fundamental pointing device support. The exact details of the scope of this proposal can be seen in the \"Pointer events\" section below. All Events listed there are musts.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Basic pointer event handling\r\n\r\nA simple example of how to handle a hover over/pointer over an element. In this case a View component.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n  <View onPointerEnter={this._onPointerEnter} onPointerLeave={this._onPointerLeave}/>\r\n\r\n  private _onPointerEnter = (event: IPointerEvent) => {\r\n    this.setState({ pointerOverElement: true });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  private _onPointerLeave = (event: IPointerEvent) => {\r\n    this.setState({ pointerOverElement: false });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Custom pointer event handling in native components\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the app's logic takes precedence when certain keystrokes are encountered at certain event routing phases in the View before the native platform can handle them.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n  <View onPointerDown={this._onPointerDown} pointerDownEvents={handledNativePointerEvents} />\r\n\r\n  const handledNativePointerEvents: IHandledPointerEvent[] = [\r\n     { button: 0, eventPhase : EventPhase.Bubbling },\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  private _onPointerDown = (event: IPointEvent) => {\r\n    if(event.nativeEvent.button == 0){\r\n            //do something AFTER the native control has had a chance to handle it (eventPhase = Bubbling)\r\n    }    \r\n  };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Detailed design\r\n\r\nThe APIs being introduced here will follow the models created by :\r\n- A React Native [discussions and proposals issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/51) submitted by contributor [empyrical](https://github.com/empyrical)\r\n- The corresponding W3C Web [Pointer events](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#dfn-chorded-button-interactions)\r\n\r\n### Pointer events\r\nThe following events will be introduced on the `View` component, as it covers the most common/prevalent use cases where listening for a mouse event (of any kind) would be needed. \r\n\r\nOther individual components where they may be needed, can wrap a `View` around their desired element/component to capture the mouse events for the children within.\r\n\r\n| API | Args | Returns | Description |\r\n|:---:|:----:|:-------:|----|\r\n| onPointerOver | IPointerEvent | void | Fires when a pointing device is moved within the hit test boundaries of a element. |\r\n| onPointerEnter | IPointerEvent | void | Fires when a pointing device is moved into the hit test boundaries of an element, including its children.|\r\n| onPointerDown | IPointerEvent | void | Fires when a pointing device's button (or buttons) state is non-negative. |\r\n| onPointerMove | IPointerEvent | void | Fires when a pointer changes coordinates when within the hit test boundaries of an element.|\r\n| onPointerUp | IPointerEvent | void | Fires when a pointing device's button (or buttons) return to negative from being non-negative. |\r\n| onPointerLeave | IPointerEvent | void | Fires when a pointing device is moved out of the hit test boundaries of an element and all of its children. |\r\n| onPointerOverCapture | IPointerEvent | void | Occurs when the `onPointerOver` event is being routed. `onPointerOver` is the corresponding bubbling event. |\r\n| onPointerEnterCapture | IPointerEvent | void | Occurs when the `onPointerEnter` event is being routed. `onPointerEnter` is the corresponding bubbling event.|\r\n| onPointerDownCapture | IPointerEvent | void | Occurs when the `onPointerDown` event is being routed. `onPointerDown` is the corresponding bubbling event. |\r\n| onPointerMoveCapture | IPointerEvent | void | Occurs when the `onPointerMove` event is being routed. `onPointerMove` is the corresponding bubbling event.|\r\n| onPointerUpCapture | IPointerEvent | void | Occurs when the `onPointerUp` event is being routed. `onPointerUp` is the corresponding bubbling event. |\r\n| onPointerLeaveCapture | IPointerEvent | void | Occurs when the `onPointerLeave` event is being routed. `onPointerLeave` is the corresponding bubbling event. |\r\n\r\nWhere `IPointerEvent` will be a new event type added to `ReactNative.NativeSyntheticEvents` of type `INativePointerEvent`.\r\n\r\n`INativePointerEvent` is a new interface and will expose the following properties:\r\n\r\n| Property | Type | Description | Default |\r\n|:---:|:----:|----|:--:|\r\n| button | number | Read-only property that indicates which button was pressed on the mouse that triggered an event fire. <br><br> **0** - Main button<br>**1** - Auxiliary button <br>**2** - Secondary button <br>**3** - Fourth button <br>**4** - Fifth button <br>**5** - Sixth button, typically pen eraser | -1 |\r\n| buttons | number | The buttons property gives the current state of the device buttons as a **bitmask**.<br><br> **1** - Left Mouse, Touch Contact, Pen contact<br>**4** - Middle Mouse <br>**2** - Right Mouse, Pen barrel button <br>**8** - X1 (back) Mouse <br>**16** - X2 (forward) Mouse <br>**32** - Pen eraser button | 0 |\r\n| eventPhase | EventPhase | Current routing phase for the event. | Bubbling |\r\n\r\nWhere `EventPhase` is an enum to detect whether the pointer button is being tunneled/bubbled to the target component that has focus. It has the following fields:\r\n\r\n- None : none\r\n- Capturing : when a pointer event is being captured while tunneling its way from the root to the target component\r\n- AtTarget : when a pointer event has reached the target component that is handling the corresponding event\r\n- Bubbling : when a pointer event is being captured while bubbling its way to the parent(s) of the target component\r\n\r\nNote: In the implementation of these events, the properties in [`NativeSyntheticEvent`](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#overview) like target, bubbles, cancelable etc., should be hooked up. For now, we shall follow the same behaviors for these as other events in react-native today.\r\n\r\n### Declarative properties\r\n\r\nTo co-ordinate the handoffs of these pointer events between the native layer and the JS layer, we are also introducing 2 corresponding properties on the `View` component. Those are:\r\n\r\n| Property | Type | Description |\r\n|:---:|:----:|----|\r\n| pointerOverEvents | IHandledPointerEvents[] | Specifies the pointer over events that are handled in the JS layer by the onPointerOver/onPointerOverCapture events |\r\n| pointerOutEvents | IHandledPointerEvents[] | Specifies the pointer over events that are handled in the JS layer by the onPointerOut/onPointerOutCapture events |\r\n| pointerDownEvents | IHandledPointerEvents[] | Specifies the button or buttons that are handled in the JS layer by the onPointerDown/onPointerDownCapture events |\r\n| pointerMoveEvents | IHandledPointerEvents[] | Specifies pointer movement events that are handled in the JS layer by the onPointerDown/onPointerDownCapture events |\r\n| pointerUpEvents | IHandledPointerEvents[] | Specifies the button or buttons that are handled in the JS layer by the onPointerUp/onPointerUpCapture events |\r\n\r\nWhere `IHandledPointerEvents` is a new type which takes the following parameters:\r\n- a number parameter named `button` to declare the pointer button that is of interest to the JS layer\r\n- a constrained string parameter named `pointerState` to declare the pointer state (string values can be one of the following: over, enter, move, leave) that is of interest to the JS layer\r\n- an `eventPhase` paramter of type `EventPhase` to declare the routing phase of interest to the JS layer.\r\n\r\n## Adoption strategy\r\n\r\nThis will be a new API and not a breaking change. This is being implemented in the `react-native-windows` out-of-tree platform first to validate the APIs and implementations. Once vetted, we propose to add this to `react-native` and add documentation in the official API documentation.\r\n\r\n## How we teach this\r\n\r\nThese APIs should be presented as a continuation of React and Windows patterns. As such, it should be very familiar to existing web/React developers as well as desktop developers who can relate these APIs to concepts they already know.\r\n\r\nOnce implemented, these APIs should be documented as part of official `react-native` API documentation.\r\n\r\n## Open Questions"
